I need a way to efficiently classify if a county was impacted by smoke. I plan to use population-weighted PM~2.5~, air quality index, temperature, and HMS for each county to do this. 

I also want to assemble data that I may consider a "true" indications of smoke, where I'll look at news reports and public health warnings that specifically mention smoke has caused harmful air quality days. I would then like to ocmpare how accurate my classifiers are against these measures of truth.

```{r setup}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=8, fig.height=6, 
                      warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

# libary
library(tidyverse)
```

Import Kriged PM~2.5~ data.
